Dear Mayor Karen Bass,

I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to you today on behalf of many residents of Los Angeles who are concerned about a significant issue affecting our city: the application of Proposition 13 and its implications on property taxes, particularly for large private entities like golf clubs.

Recently, I came across an episode of Malcolm Gladwell's podcast, Revisionist History, titled "The Problem with Golf." The episode sheds light on the expansive and private golf courses in Los Angeles, specifically those in affluent neighborhoods like Brentwood. It addresses an important issue about the use of large tracts of valuable land and highlights how it contributes to the inequity in our city.

But the deeper issue, and the main focus of my letter today, is the connection between these golf courses and Proposition 13. As you know, Proposition 13 regulates the taxation of property in California. While the intent behind the proposition was to ensure fair taxation and prevent sudden increases, its current implementation seems to create a loophole for private clubs such as these golf courses.

These clubs, with memberships that are ever-changing, are often not taxed at fair market value for their expansive properties due to Prop 13. This outcome is resulting in a significant loss of potential revenue for our city and inadvertently shifting the tax burden to other property owners who are not privileged with such loopholes. Moreover, the lack of taxation contributes to the growing economic divide in our city, impacting critical city services and resources that could aid the underserved communities and the unhoused population.

Therefore, I urge you, as our elected Mayor, to reconsider the application of Proposition 13 in these instances. It is vital for our city to close this loophole that primarily benefits the affluent and often excludes the general public from these large, potentially shared spaces.

The potential revenue gained from appropriately taxing these properties could provide much-needed funds for affordable housing, public parks, education, and other city services that directly impact the quality of life for all Los Angeles residents, not just a privileged few.

This open letter is being shared with others who are equally concerned about this issue. It is our collective plea for you to advocate for a revision of Proposition 13 in its current form and ensure a fairer, more equitable taxation system. By doing so, we can make Los Angeles a city that truly serves all its residents, regardless of their economic standing.

Thank you for your time and for your dedicated service to our city. We trust in your commitment to bring about change that fosters equity and fairness.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
